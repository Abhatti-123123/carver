Necessary to back adjust prices for dividends and interest since that change isn't loss but what we get credited in account (Panama method)
Sharpe involves subtract risk free rate
Sharpe divides by std which penalizes high returns vol as well
Sortino can be used to check the negative skew
Both sharpe and sortino are important
Instead of max draw down average drawdown can be preferred
Since returns are definitely fat tailed its better to model accordingly
For checking fat tailed natures its better to use lower percentile ratio and upper percentile ratio rather than kurtosis

###If we do equal weighting when calculating standard deviation; If there was a large return28 days back; it would cause a large jump in std when it goes out of the window causing fake vol display. (Good to use exponential weighted average instead) (lambda 0.6 is optimal refer Carver pg 99)
###Std clusters in short run but mean reverts in long run
For predicting future vol: its good to blend between short run vol and long run vol so as not to have big weights during crisis



Annualization of daily std only work if no auto correlation between returns otherwise spurious returns but still can be used for our cases generally

Futures:
Safe to back fill mini future prices before 2019 when testing for micro ones

Instruments  that  are  riskier  will  usually  have  higher  initial  margin
requirements, so we’d need more cash to start trading them. They also have
the potential for larger losses once we’re holding them, requiring more cash
to cover these losses in the form of variation margin.

Efficient portfolio optimization is only necessary when we don't have access to leverage to tweak the risk

For covariance calculation long term covariance is preferred because they are more stable at least 20 days

Ratios:

leverage ratio = Volatility ratio = total risk appetite / risk on single contract = portfolio loss% / 1 contract loss%
contract leverage ratio = notional exposure per contract / capital

leverage = capital wiped / move in the contract


Kelly optimal risk is theoretically equal to strategies sharpe ratio
Generally target risk should be half of optimal risk

Its important to keep initial weights when the look back values are not set to 1 to keep the initial trades from blowing up. Or maybe no trades until look back values setup
Trend indicators like macd do much better for long positions, We should not go short with them and instead use them to close our the position
The sizing should be done with volatility not confidence score for better results and lower risk. This is will give better sharpe throughout
Higher sharpe is better than higher returns, since strategies with higher sharpe can be leveraged more safely for higher returns
Capping the extreme values of indicator output is very important to avoid blowing up cause those are times when there might be quick reversal
But capping also leads to loss of magnitude differences in values greater then the cap so wherever possible min-max scaling is better than caping unless the extreme values are ridiculous.
We should also include reversal probabilities to sizing logic to reduces blowing up account due to fluctuation
To get meaningful indicator value through history we need to adjust for risk and trading price

Equity and commodities generally have sharp bounce back after strong negative trend vice versa not true
VIX generally have sharp fall after strong positive trend vice verca not true
